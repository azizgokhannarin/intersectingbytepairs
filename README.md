## Features

- **Flexible and Scalable:** Easily adaptable to different datasets and applications.
- **Open Source:** Open to community contributions and continuously being developed.

## Installation

### Requirements

- **CMake**: Version 3.10 or higher
- **C++ Compiler**: Supporting C++11 or higher (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/azizgokhannarin/intersectingbytepairs.git
    cd intersectingbytepairs
    ```
2. **Create a Build Directory:**
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

3. **Configure the Project with CMake:**
    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```
    *If you need to specify custom installation paths or enable/disable features, you can pass additional flags to CMake. For example:*
    ```bash
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/desired/install/path -DENABLE_ASSIMP=ON ..
    ```

4. **Build the Project:**
    ```bash
    cmake --build .
    ```
    *Alternatively, you can use make or your preferred build system:*
    ```bash
    make
    ```

5. **Install the Project (Optional):**
    ```bash
    cmake --install .
    ```
    *This step installs the built binaries and resources to the specified installation directory.*

## Usage

With the encode process, 2 different byte values ​​are converted to vector values. There are 2 different values ​​in 2 different cubes according to the X and Y intersection points. The only dimension they are different in is Z. Then, these values ​​are returned encoded in 2 different byte values ​​according to these processes.

## Examples

You can reformat two different bytes with the encode and decode methods.
